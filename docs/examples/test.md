# Test

test.js is a simple application that shows you how
to use the [Platform](../platform.md) API and do basic
websocket communication between JavaScript running
in the browser and the JavaScript running on the Fluxn0de.

Make sure to edit [test.js](../../spiffs_image/test.js) and
configure your wifi SSID and password. You should do this before
flashing the your Fluxn0de (or if you forgot you can use the Fluxn0de recovery wifi access point to upload your modified version of test.js).

Take a look at the browser code in [index.html](../../spiffs_image/index.html).

# Running it

`192.168.4.1` is the default IP for Fluxn0de in Wifi AP mode.

In a web browser navigate [http://192.168.4.1/](http://192.168.4.1/) and open the JavaScript console.

You should see things happening in the JavaScript console.
